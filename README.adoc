This library adds co-located CSS support to Fulcro 3 components.  Fulcro 2.x and earlier have this 
integrated by default, but 3+ enables this to be a pure library concern, which allows more room for
others to provide alternate approaches to solving the problem.

== Usage

YOU MUST install the following middleware in your Fulcro 3 app for this library to work:


```
TODO
```

(from there, see Developer's guide...other than the require namespaces it will work the same)
